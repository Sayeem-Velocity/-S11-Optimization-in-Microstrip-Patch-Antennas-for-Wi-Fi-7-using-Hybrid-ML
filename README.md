🛠️ Project Overview
In this project, I designed a microstrip patch antenna targeting Wi-Fi 7 frequency bands and evaluated its performance using key parameters such as S11, gain, bandwidth, and radiation pattern.

After simulating various antenna designs in CST Studio Suite, I exported the results to Excel, built a custom dataset, and applied hybrid machine learning algorithms to predict and optimize antenna performance—specifically focusing on minimizing the S11 parameter, crucial for impedance matching and signal efficiency.

🚀 Optimization Pipeline
