🛠️ Project Overview
In this project, I designed a microstrip patch antenna intended for Wi-Fi 7 frequency bands and analyzed its performance through key metrics like the S11 parameter, gain, bandwidth, and radiation pattern.

After simulation, I collected results from CST Studio Suite and leveraged Hybrid Machine Learning algorithms to optimize the antenna parameters—focusing on minimizing the S11 parameter, which is crucial for efficient signal reflection and matching.
